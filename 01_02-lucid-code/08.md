On my home PC I have MSI MEG CoreLiquid S360 motherboard. Drivers are not permanently flashed into it, instead they are set each time by MSI Control Center Windows which makes it impossible to have silent mode without first loading Windows. `liquidctl`, a TUI program that lets you control fan system, has open [pull-request](https://github.com/liquidctl/liquidctl/pull/784) that would get the access to motherboard, though no sooner than maintaining team will merge it. So I found a driver written in C and rewrote it as a side-project.
```diff
# Abstract class for two-dimensional shapes such as rectangle, triangle etc.
# Also Shape should be made universal from the start, not only for 2D.
- public abstract class AObject2D
+ public abstract class Shape


# Abstract class for controllable "alive" entity in my Unity3D game which is in fact 2D.
# Since there are lot of differences between 3D and 2D in Unity, this postfix was kept.
- public abstract class ACreature2D
+ public abstract class Creature2D

On my home PC I have MSI MEG CoreLiquid S360 motherboard. Drivers are not permanently flashed into it, instead they are set each time by MSI Control Center Windows which makes it impossible to have silent mode without first loading Windows. `liquidctl`, a TUI program that lets you control fan system, has open [pull-request](https://github.com/liquidctl/liquidctl/pull/784) that would get the access to motherboard, though no sooner than maintaining team will merge it. So I found a driver written in C and rewrote it as a side-project.
```diff
# 1. This function initializes sensors, finds **subfeature**, reads temperature from it, then writes it back with new information from `handle`
- void monitor_cpu_temperature(hid_device *handle) 
# I rewrote it into separate functions:
# 1.1 Function that, if found, writes address into sensors_subfeature pointer and returns an integer 0 if success, -1 otherwise
+ const int get_temperature_chip_subfeature(const sensors_subfeature *subfeature);

# 1.2 A common pattern in C having while(global variable flag) loop that is stops whenever a signal is received
# Those functions called daemons, they run in the background
# Instead of relying on accessing flag directly as a global variable a pointer to it is passed:
+ int run_monitor_daemon(hid_device *handle, const sensors_subfeature *subfeature, int *should_stop);


# 1.3 Reads temperature from said subfeature, writes the result in temperature pointer
# Retuns 0 if success, -1 otherwise
+ int get_chip_subfeature_temperature(const sensors_subfeature *subfeature, double *temperature);


# 1.4 Writes temperature to a handle
# Returns 0 if success, -1 otherwise
int write_chip_subfeature_temperature(hid_device *handle, double temperature) {
